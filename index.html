      <h1>Adam & Marina are getting married!</h1>

      <p>We’re going to the beach, and we’re gonna get married!</p>

      <p>Join us for five days and four nights of swimming, grilling, s’mores, and revelry in Jensen Beach, Florida.</p>

      <h2>Accommodations</h2>
      <p>We have rented a house directly on Jensen Beach large enough to accommodate all invited. The residence includes access to kayaks, surfboards, paddleboards, bicycles, a ping pong table, a fire pit, an exercise area, fishing gear, metal detectors, etc.! We sincerely hope you join us in this immersive joining of families as we prepare for, participate in, and revel in the aftermath of the nuptials themselves.</p>

      <p>If you would be more comfortable in your own accommodations and would like help locating an appropriate venue, please contact Marina, who would be happy to librarian that for you!</p>

      <p><a href=''>Click here</a> for more information about our venue (or just to drool over pictures)</p>

      <h2>Travel and Transportation</h2>
      <p>No one we know lives in Jensen Beach, so everyone will be traveling. Thank you so much, your presence means the world to us!</p>

      <p>West Palm Beach International Airport (airport code: PBI) is the closest major airport, about an hour away by car. You may want to consider renting a car as well, especially if you are going to want to do some independent exploring. All of the major car rental companies have hubs (and corresponding shuttles) near the airport.</p>

      <h2>Ceremony and Reception</h2>
      <p>We’re getting hitched right behind the beach house on Friday December 1st around 4pm. Dress however you’re most comfortable; we’re almost family here, after all.</p>

      <p>Reception will be picnic-style following the ceremony.</p>
